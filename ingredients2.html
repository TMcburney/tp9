<li>Butter.I use salted butter, but unsalted butter would also be great. I just recommend tasting the dough to ensure that it's salted to your liking.</li>
<li>White Sugar. You can use granulated white sugar or organic cane sugar.</li>
<li>Brown sugar. I use light brown sugar in this recipe for the best results.</li>
<li>Flour. I recommend using an unbleached, all-purpose flour to make these chocolate chip cookies.</li>
<li>Sea Salt. I exclusively bake and cook with pure, fine sea salt.</li>
<li>Chocolate Chips. As you can see from the photos, sometimes I use chocolate chunks, chopped chocolate, or chocolate chips.</li>
